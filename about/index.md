## About Me
I started Sycer *checks watch* about 6 hours ago. Going under the name Fyko's Development was geting old, so I came up with Sycer. Don't ask about how I came up with the name, I have no clue.
I strive to provide superb services for cook group owners, individuals, or those who just wanna test the program. With 6 months of Node.JS and Discord experience, I started to branch out into other APIs and situations. Look where I am now, juggling the Twitter API, one of the worlds largest social media outlets.
I encourage my clients to expand their horizons and comminicate and like with other people like them, sprouting their success and becoming successful in suck a hot market.
