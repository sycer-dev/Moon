I'm happy to announce the release of Sycer's newest service, **Kermit**. Kermit allows group owners to send text messages to everyone in their group with ease.

It's incredibly easy to activate your group and load credits with our fully autonomous restock system with Selly integration. It's as simple as purchasing a key from [our store](https://sms.sycer.dev/) and running `?redeem`.

Click [here](https://sycer.dev/kermit) to be redirected to the offical listing.

### Security

When one of your member signs up, a new onboard session is started in DMs where they are added to your list only after verifying their phone number with a 5-digit security code. This keeps EUD (end-user data) safe and out of the wrong hands.


### Features
* International texting
* Cusomizable maximum
* Downloadable client list
* Detailed logs
* Bulk discounts!

### Pricing
$35 one-time activation fee and 3Â¢ text/user.
Custom branded for $40 a month or $200 lifetime.
