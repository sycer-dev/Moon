I'm happy to announce the release of Sycer's newest service, **Elmo**. Elmo DMs users when one of their designated words or phrases is said within the server. 

It's incredibly easy to activate your group with our fully autonomous restock system with Selly integration from Kermit. It's as simple as purchasing a key from [our store](https://elmo.sycer.dev/) and running `?redeem`.
